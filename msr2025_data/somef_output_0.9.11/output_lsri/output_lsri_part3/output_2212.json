Where possible, please write a test case\n\nIf you are not able to do that, that's fine! Open an issue anyway and let us\nknow as much information as you can. We will get back to you to determine the\nproblem, and (hopefully) fix it.\n\n\n### Submit feedback\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to [create a new\nissue](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH/issues/new) on GitHub.\n\nIf you are proposing a feature:\n\n* Explain how you see it working. Try to be as detailed as you can.\n* Try to keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will help make it easier to\n  implement.\n* Feel free to include any code you might already have, even if it is\n  just a rough idea. This is a volunteer-driven project, and contributions are\n  welcome :)\n\n\n## Pull Request Guidelines\n\nHere are a few rules to follow in order to make code reviews and discussions go\nmore smoothly before maintainers accept and merge your work:\n\n* You MUST run the test suite.\n* You MUST write (or update) unit tests.\n* You SHOULD write documentation.\n\nPlease, write [commit messages that make\nsense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),\nand [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\nbefore submitting your Pull Request.\n\nYou may be asked to [squash your\ncommits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)\ntoo. This is to \"clean\" your Pull Request before merging it (we try to avoid\ncommits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).\n\nAlso, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description\nwhich gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.\n\nFor further information about creating a Pull Request, please read [this blog\npost](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/11/20/on-creating-pull-requests/).\n\nThank you!\n"

We do not provide support for other platforms, but since **buildH** has been written in pure Python, it should work there provided its dependencies are supported. \n\n## Simple installation\n\nA simple installation with pip will do the trick:\n\n```\npython3 -m pip install buildh\n```\n\nAll dependencies (modules) will be installed automatically by pip.\n\nNote that this way of proceeding will install **buildH** and its dependencies within the python of your Unix system, which may lead to conflicts of version if you have other scientific packages installed. To avoid this you may want to create a specific conda or virtual environment for **buildH** (see below).\n\n## Installation within a conda environment\n\n**buildH** is also available through the [Bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/buildh) channel.\n\nWe recommend to install **buildH** within a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). First create a new conda env:\n\n```\nconda create -n buildH \"python>=3.6\"\n```\n\nThen activate your environment:\n\n```\nconda activate buildH\n```\n\nLast, install **buildH** within that environment:\n\n```\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda install buildh\n```\n\n## Building from source\n\nWe recommend to use a specific environment, either by using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands). All packages will be installed within that environment which avoids conflicts of version.\n\nIf you still do not want to create a specific environment for **buildH**, you can skip the first section `Create an environment` below.\n\nIn any case, the python version should be >= 3.6.\n\n### Create an environment\n\nFirst, create a new environment (we call it `env4buildH`):\n\n- If you chose conda: `conda create -n env4buildH python=3.8`\n- If you chose venv: `python3 -m venv /path/to/env4buildH`\n\nActivate your environment:\n\n- If you chose conda: `conda activate env4buildH`\n- If you chose venv: `source /path/to/env4buildH/bin/activate`\n\n### Install **buildH** from source\n\nClone the **buildH** repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH.git\ncd buildH\n```\n\nInstall with `pip` the packages required by **buildH**, namely numpy, pandas, MDAnalysis and Numba, which are all specified in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH/blob/master/requirements.txt):\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nInstall **buildH** from source with `pip`:\n\n```\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## For developers\n\nFor installing a development version from source with the full environment (allowing building the doc, launching tests, etc.), see [here](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH/tree/master/devtools/install_dev.md).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe tests rely on the `pytest` package. You need first to install a development version (see above). Once done, you can run the tests with just:\n\n```\ncd buildh # if it's not already the case\npytest\n```\n\nAll tests should pass. If anything fails, please [open an issue](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH/issues).\n"

The def file can be found [here](https://github.com/patrickfuchs/buildH/blob/master/def_files/Berger_POPC.def). The final order parameters averaged over the trajectory will be written to the default output name `OP_buildH.out`\n\nOther detailed examples and Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the documentation at [Read the Docs](https://buildh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n\n**Important**: sometimes, when performing MD, some molecules are split over periodic boundary conditions (PBC). **buildH** takes as input whole structures (pdb, gro, xtc, etc.). If broken molecules are supplied, it will most likely generate nonsense results. So it is up to the user to take care of making molecules whole before running **buildH** (e.g. by using a tool like [trjconv](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/onlinehelp/gmx-trjconv.html) in GROMACS with flag `-pbc mol`).\n\nInvoking **buildH** with the `-h` flag will display some help to the screen and tell which lipids are supported.\n\n```\n$ buildH -h\nusage: buildH [-h] [-v] -c COORD [-t TRAJ] -l LIPID [-lt LIPID_TOPOLOGY [LIPID_TOPOLOGY ...]] -d\n              DEFOP [-opx OPDBXTC] [-o OUT] [-b BEGIN] [-e END] [-igch3]\n[...]\nThe list of supported lipids (-l option) are: Berger_CHOL, Berger_DOPC, Berger_DPPC, Berger_POP, Berger_POPC, Berger_PLA, Berger_POPE, Berger_POPS, CHARMM36UA_DPPC, CHARMM36UA_DPUC, CHARMM36_POPC, GROMOS53A6L_DPPC, GROMOSCKP_POPC, GROMOSCKP_POPS.
