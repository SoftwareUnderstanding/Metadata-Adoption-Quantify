It's people like you that truly make the Semantic Web more accessible to everyone :)\n\n## Communication channels\n\nIf you would like to get in touch with the grlc developers, and with other users of grlc, you can reach us in two ways:\n - Via Twitter, by using the grlc handle (**@grlcldapi**). Follow this account to hear about updates.\n - Via the grlc [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/grlc-list/). Sign up to the mailing list to ask questions and make suggestions.\n\n## Filing bug reports\n\nThe official channel to file bug reports is via our GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc/issues). When doing so make sure that:\n- Your issue title briefly describes the bug\n- You include log output (try `docker logs grlc_grlc_1` if you daemonized your instance)\n- Name the file/module if known/available\n- You tag your issue as **bug**\n\n## Sending feature requests\n\nAs with bug reports, for requesting features please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc/issues) as well and this time:\n- Describe briefly the feature in the title\n- Describe the desired feature\n- Describe your use case so we understand what you are using grlc for\n- Name the file/module if known/available\n- Tag the issue as **enhancement**\n\n## Sending pull requests\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the code directly, please send in a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc/pulls). Please make sure that:\n - The title of your PR briefly describes the content\n - Describe in detail what your PR contributes\n - If your PR addresses a specific issue, indicate the issue number\n - Assign @albertmeronyo or @c-martinez as reviewer of your PR.\n\n## Testing environment\n\nTo get started with hacking grlc, follow these steps to create a local testing environment (you'll need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)):\n\n1. `docker pull clariah/grlc:latest`\n2. `git clone https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc`\n3. `cd grlc`\n4. Create a `docker-compose.yml` which matches your needs. For example:\n```\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  grlc:\n    build: ./\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n     - \"8001:80\"\n    environment:\n     - DEBUG=true\n     - USERMAP_GID=1000\n     - USERMAP_UID=1000\n     - GRLC_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxx\n     - GRLC_GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=yyy\n     - GRLC_SERVER_NAME=grlc.io\n```\n\n5. `docker-compose up`\n6. Your local grlc instance should be available at http://localhost:8001 and should respond to code modifications you make on `<GRLC_CLONE_PATH>`\n\nYou're good to pick any issue at the  [issue tracker](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc/issues) marked as **enhancement** and start implementing it :)\n\n## Governance model\n\nAs creators of grlc, [@albertmeronyo](https://github.com/albertmeronyo) and [@c-martinez](http://github.com/c-martinez) are benevolent dictators for this project. This means that they have a final say of the direction of the project. This DOES NOT mean they are not willing to listen to suggestion (on the contrary, they *love* to hear new ideas)!\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll grlc contributors will be listed in the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. Also, [notes of new releases](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc/releases) will mention who contributed to that specific release.\n\n## Questions\n\nPlease open an issue at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc/issues) and tag it as **question**\n"
